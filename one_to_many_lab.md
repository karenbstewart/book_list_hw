# One to Many Lab

Your task is to model a Flask app which contains 2 classes that have a One To Many relationship.

- Authors and Books

To start: 
- create the database (the name can be found in the sql runner file) 
- run your sql file in your database to create your table structure
- then run your console to persist some author and book objects to your database.

## MVP

In your application you should be able to perform the following actions:

* View all Books along with detail of the Author (name/title/etc)
* Delete a Book
* Be able to create a new Book
* View a single Book

## Extensions

* Edit a Book
* Style the app using CSS


#### Guidance

* Create one route at a time and the templates required for that route before moving onto the next.
* Dont just copy and paste! Write out the routes and templates from scratch to get your bearings better (it really works).
* ...Be sure to check if your blueprint has been registered in app.py
